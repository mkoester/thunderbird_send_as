# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons here:

- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon-96.png` - 96x96 pixels

## Design Suggestions

The icon should represent email aliasing or plus-addressing:
- An envelope with a "+" symbol
- Multiple envelope variations
- "@" symbol with "+" overlay

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using:
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (free)
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (free, vector)
- Any graphic design tool

## Temporary Solution

For now, you can use simple placeholder icons or emoji-based designs until you create proper ones.
